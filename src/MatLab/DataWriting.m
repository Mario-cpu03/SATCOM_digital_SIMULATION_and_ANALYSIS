%%% Data Wirting Script

%% The script DataWriting.m is responsible for the data persistence logic 
% implementation. 

% Two .csv files will be produced as the ouput, ready for an RStudio 
% statistical analysis (visit "../RStudio/" to see source code 
% or "../../results/" and "../../docs/" to see the final results and report)

% The first dataset will contains data produced by the Convolution Coded
% simulation, while the second one will contains data of the Non coded
% transmissions.

% Each dataset will have the structure that follows:
% BER, THROUGHPUT, AWGN, MeanAtmLoss, 
% T, Den, THERMAL_NOISE.
