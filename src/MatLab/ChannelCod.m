%%% ChannelCod Script

%% The script ChannelCod.m is responsible for the BER and throughput evaluation 
% on a Convolutional coded channel.

% The coding rate will be of 1/2, the bare minimun, due to the assumption
% of non-critical communications.

% For the same reason, no encryption methods will be implemented.

% Another fundamental assumption is that the two terrestial nodes represent
% operative military bases, so their reception systems and antennas 
% will be stationary.

% Weather conditions will follow the assumption of equiprobability, 
% in order to model different meteorological conditions without focusing 
% on the geolocation of the nodes or other parameters. These conditions 
% will be represented by the temperature "T", pressure "P", and atmospheric 
% water vapor density "Den".
% In this context, T and Den will be random variables strictly 
% correlated with the Atmospheric Attenuation (L). Note that this quantity 
% will vary depending on the considered link, due to the different carrier 
% frequencies.
% For simplicity, scintillation effects will not be considered.
