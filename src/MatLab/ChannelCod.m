%%% ChannelCod Script

%% The script ChannelCod.m is responsible for the BER and throughput evaluation 
% on a Convolutional coded channel.

% The coding rate will be of 1/2, the bare minimun, due to the assumption
% of non-critical communications.

% For the same reason, no encryption methods will be implemented.

% Another fundamental assumption is that the two terrestial nodes represent
% operative military bases, so their reception systems and antennas 
% will be stationary.
