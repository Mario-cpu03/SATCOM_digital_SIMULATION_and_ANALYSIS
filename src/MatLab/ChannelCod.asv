%%% ChannelCod Script

%% The script ChannelCod.m is responsible for the BER and throughput evaluation 
% on a Convolutional coded channel.

% The coding rate will be of 1/2, the bare minimun, due to the assumpiont
% of non critical communications.

% For the same reason, no cyprhing methods will be implemented.

% Another fundamental assumption is that the two terrestial nodes  

function [] = ChannelCod(MonteCarlo, NumMessages, BitTx, BitRx, BitAck)
