Summary of the simulated results.
Please note that the following values represent the average performance of the system, computed over all MonteCarlo iterations. Each iteration simulates the exchange of three messages, both with and without convolutional coding -respectively in Sim. 1 and Sim. 2- to provide a robust estimate of the systemâ€™s average behavior under varying conditions.
