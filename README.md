# SATCOM_digital_SIMULATION_and_ANALYSIS


### Project Description:
The project aims to simulate the communication, on a low level view, of two nodes using Digital SATCOM. Using simulated results, obtained thanks to ad hoc MATLAB scripts, a statistical analysis  will be conducted.
A linear regression model will formalize correlations between the 
overall system's performance and all of the other's modeled parameters, such as transmissive power, distance and meteorological conditions. 


### Repository Structure:
- **src/**: Source code, divided in two directories. "src/MatLab/" contains .m source code, whereas "src/RStudio/" contains .R source code.
- **data/**: Project related datasets, i.e. the one with simulated results
- **assets/**: Static resources
- **results/**: RStudio and Matlab generated results that needs persistence logic
- **docs/**: Report with results analysis and interpretation.
 

### How to Interpret the Project:
If you're just interested in the analysis results, then visit "./results/" and "./docs/" where you will find relevant content generated as if you've ran the project.
If you want to test the source code:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mario-cpu03/ATCOM_digital_SIMULATION_and_ANALYSIS.git
    ```
2. Open the project in MATLAB.
3. Run the scripts in the `src/MatLab/` folder to perform the simulation.
4. Open the project in the `src/RStudio/` folder
5. Run the scripts in the same folder to perform the analysis.
