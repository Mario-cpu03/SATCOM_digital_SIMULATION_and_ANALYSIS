# SATCOM_digital_SIMULATION_and_ANALYSIS

### Project Description:
The project aims to simulate the communication, on a low level view, of two nodes using Digital SATCOM. Using simulated results, obtained thanks to ad hoc MATLAB scripts, a statistical analysis  will be conducted.
A linear regression model will formalize correlations between the 
overall system's performance and all of the other's modeled parameters, such as transmissive power, distance and meteorological conditions.
